# Market App
A market needs an app that can give products to the users. This market sells 4 categories of food. Meat, Fruit, Vegetables and Beverages. Every item has an id, price, company and type. The client wants this app to: 
* Get all items
* Filter items ( by company or type) 
* Get item by id
* Get items in price range

The client wants all elements of the app to be validated and to tell the user if they are using it incorrectly with descriptive error messages and always given a chance to enter data again if they fail. 

 Bonus:  after choosing any option except getItemById ask the user how to sort the items ( by Company Name, Price or Item type Asc and Desc options ) 

 Bonus:  user should login with only an id before they enter the app. If the ID starts with "mart" then that employee has bonus card and will get all prices on a 10% discount ( ex: mart2402 has bonus card. hakd2104 does not)
